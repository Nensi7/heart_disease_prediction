# Heart Disease Prediction Project - Overview

This project explores the application of machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. By leveraging a dataset of 100,000 patient records, we implemented and evaluated three distinct classification models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a linear model (likely Logistic Regression or Linear Discriminant Analysis).

The dataset was strategically partitioned into five subsets, each containing 20,000 rows. This partitioning approach facilitated efficient processing and allowed for robust model evaluation.

The project workflow involved several key stages:

1.  Data Preprocessing: This crucial step ensured data quality and suitability for the chosen models. It likely included handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
2.  Model Implementation: We implemented the Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and a linear model using relevant Python libraries.
3.  Training and Evaluation: Each model was trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The partitioning of the dataset into five parts was instrumental in this stage.

The results of the model evaluations provide insights into the predictive capabilities of each algorithm for this specific task. Further improvements could involve more extensive feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization and exploring more advanced modeling techniques.

The code for this project is available in a Colab notebook, which provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce the analysis and results. The project relies on popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to a critical healthcare problem. The insights gained can potentially contribute to the development of tools for early heart disease risk assessment.
